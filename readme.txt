Assignment 2
===============

In this assignment you shall develop an automated framework for training and evaluating basic NN models.

Unlike in assignment 1, you can (you should) use the full functionality of PyTorch and all its packages to develop the complete pipeline starting from data preparation, through all the steps we discussed in the course, to the final model evaluation.

The details of the assignment are explained in the two jupyter notebooks in this folder. 

1) Begin with the feed forward model in mlp.ipynb
2) Follow with the cnn model in cnn.ipynb

You shall submit you assignments via e-learning.
The submission deadline is on Thursday 20. June at 23:59
You can work on the assignment in groups of 2 or individually - please keep the same groups as in Assignment 1.


Fof the submission, please create a zip that contains 
- the executable jupyter notebooks
- html export of the notebooks with your final run of the code and your comments (this is to avoid problems "oh, somehow in the submission the notebook does not show what I want ...")
- all associated scripts, images etc.

Use your k-number for the zipfile name.
If you work in pairs, please do not submit the same work twice.
Submit just once and name the zipfile using using both of your k-numbers.
